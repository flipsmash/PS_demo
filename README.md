# PS Thought Exercise Files #
### Brian Finnegan, March 14, 2024 ###

Data wrangling, visualization and analysis to demonstrate my capacities :smiley:

All relevant code can be found in the 2 jupyter notebook files, data_transformation&analysis_python.ipynb and Item_response_Theory_R.ipynb.
PDFs of these notebooks can be found in the 'Presentation' directory.

Python code is duplicated in PS_demo.py.

Looking forward to joining your team!
